### Welcome to my sanctuary!

Hello mate!

Thank you for visiting my personal page! I hope you'll enjoy your stay here in my own zen.

My name is Tra. You can call me Tea if you want! 

I love beauty in general, especially in both art and music!

Currently I am studying Bachelor of 3D Art & Animation at TAFE, NSW, Australia.

I still find myself learning about art and animation, therefore, it would be great if you and I had a chance for any discussion about it.  

Please, don't hesitate to drop me an email at tearawood31@gmail.com.

Best wishes,

Tra
